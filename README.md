# FormBasedUI---React
Machine Coding

Problem Statement: 
Three tabs: Profile, Interest, and Settings, with specified field requirements like
 - Age Field: Only numeric values allowed.
 - Email Field: Validation to ensure correct format.

Had to incorporate dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, and implement:
 - Validation for mandatory fields
 - Data persistence across tabs
 - Submit button that submitted entire form only on last tab.

Scalability: How easily the form could be extended or modified without rewriting significant portions of code.
Maintainability: How modular, readable, and organized code is crucial for large teams and log-term projects.
